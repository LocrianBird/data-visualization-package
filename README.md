## Course review visualization package

A package of files that combine different charts and graphs, sort of visualized data, taken from "reviews.csv".
Pandas was used for working with data files. For the Jupyter Notebook files "reviews" and "Visualization", Matplotlib was used for rendering graphs, however in simple Python files Highcharts library was used as a template for graphs and charts.
JustPy Framework was a base for the frontend part.
